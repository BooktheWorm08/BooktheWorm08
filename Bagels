By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

I am thinking of a {} digit number with no repeated digits.
Try to guess what it is. here are some clues:
When I say:			That means:
	Pico					One digit is correct, but in the wrong position.
 	Fermi					One digit id correct and in the right position.
	Bagles				No digit is correct.
 
For example, if the secret number is 248 and your guess was 843,
the clues would be Fermi Pico.'''.format(NUM_DIGITS))

	while True: # Main game Loop.
 			# This stores the secret number the player needs to guess:
			secretNum = getSecretNum()
	 		print('I have thought up a number.')
			print('You have {} guesses to get it.'.format(MAX-GUESSES))

			numGuesses = 1
	 		while numGuesses <= MAX_GUESSES:
					guess = ''
		 			# Keep looping until they entera valid guess:
					while len(guess) != NUM_DIGITS or not guess.isdecimal():
		 					print('Guess #{}: '.format(numGuesses))
